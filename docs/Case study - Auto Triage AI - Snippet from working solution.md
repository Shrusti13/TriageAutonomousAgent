**Snippets of working solution**

**Agent 1 -- Triage Agent**

The Triage Agent is responsible for handling the initial triage of
issues. This involves using email as a trigger and testing with the Test
Trigger to ensure that the process is functioning correctly.

Outcome of Autonomous run of Triage Agent --

    confirming that their concern has been received and is being
    addressed.
